/**When should i use maps or objects */

/*Question to self do we need a simple list of values?? 

if so then we use - Array , Set :

~Should use these for simple list of values when we do not need to describe values
~We should use arrays when we need to store values in order or when they might contain duplicates, arrays have tons of data manipulation methods

~sets are used are best for high performance operation searches and are generally used to complement arrays
if we need key/value pairs

then we use Object or Maps
Objects - traditional js k/v structure since js didnt have hashmaps, easy to write, easy to access using . and [] operators

disadvantages:


Maps - better performance for k/v stores so better suited, also better for mapping k/v's when keys arent strings
